    Input: cost matrix 'c', requiremets vector 'r'
    Output: objective value, dictionary of edges with multiplicities

    The algorithm generates all c^N degree sequences of directed trees on N vertices, and solves the underlying
    transportation problem. For each degree sequence, it enumerates all directed spanning trees realising the degree
    sequence, and chooses the cheapest one. It returns the multigraph with minimal overall cost.
    Three modes:
    1) rootedQ=False, boundedQ=False: it enumerates degree sequences of directed trees (~11.09^n)
    2) rootedQ=True, boundedQ=False: it enumerates degree sequences of rooted trees (~4^n)
    3) rootedQ=True, boundedQ=True: it enumerates degree sequences of rooted trees, but omits infeasible ones (i.e.
       where d_T(v) would be higher than r(v)
    Note: in the paper, this algorithm is described in ยง2.2.1 as an improved version of enum-MV
